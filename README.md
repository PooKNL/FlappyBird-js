# FlappyBird-js v 0.05

My first basic game in vanilla JavaScript in combination with HTML5 canvas. This is based on the Coding Train tutorial on youtube. 
There is a little ball that can be controlled by hitting the space bar and pipes are moving in the direction of the player.
There are already functions in place which detect whether the ball (bird) hit a pipe. The next step would be actually adding a game over feature
and score mechanics. I've added a nice little background to make it a bit more lively.

When my JavaScript knowledge has improved I will get back into making it a lot more interesting. :)

Kind regards, Robert Jan
